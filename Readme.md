# Dwitter - a decentralised message board.

dwitter is a decentralised message board. It uses the ethereum blockchain and is currently deployed on the ropsten testnet.

## Getting Started

To access the dApp you can use the web interface: [https://andiwi.github.io/dwitter](https://andiwi.github.io/dwitter)

## Project Architecture

### Smart Contracts

The smart contracts of the dApp are developed by using the truffle framework and deployed on the ropsten ethereum testnet.

### Web Interface

The dApp can be used through the web interface. The web interface can be accessed here: [https://andiwi.github.io/dwitter](https://andiwi.github.io/dwitter).
To perform new blockchain transactions (e.g. like dweets, post new dweets) you must connect your wallet.

The web interface is based on react.js, material-ui and ethers.js.

## Troubleshooting

If you want to use ganache to test on a local blockchain, make sure that you use node version 8.x.
